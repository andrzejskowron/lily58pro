# Default Plaid-Pad Layout

This is the default layout for the plaid pad. 
The upper left (7) and right (/) switch, can be replaced by a rotary encoder.
Encoders with built-in switch are supported and map to the original keys (7) and (/).

The upper left encoder performs a tap on "Right Arrow" (KC_RIGHT) and "Left Arrow" (KC_LEFT)  when rotated clockwise and counter-clockwise in the respective direction for each step of the encoder. 

The upper right encoder performs a tap on "Up Arrow" (KC_UP) and "Down Arrow" (KC_DOWN) when rotated clockwise and counter-clockwise in the respective direction for each step of the encoder.
